# TODOs for MA

## needed for MA

- Integrate ID to hash function
- integrate ID in F, S and T and in P
- check if this is working

## optional things

- get Level I, III and V in one directory (set compile flags in makefile) (almost no differences between directories)
- get Classic, Cyclic and Cyclic_compressed in one file (set compile flags in makefile)
- same for AVX2 and SSE3?
